# Sy'k Fiar

Sy'k Fiar is an ancient language in the fictional world Rhyn, that was spoken by humans and magic beings alike before the Shattering. It is also known as the gods tongue as the user is able to embed magic into the words. After the Shattering however, it has lost its significance. Most humans now speak the common language while Sy'k Fiar is only known in academic circles and the few populations of magical creatures that survived the Shattering.

# Syntax

## Simple Structure

The simple sentences are built from a Subject and a Verb connected by the topic particle _est_:

_Subject-est-Verb_

Example:

_fyre(S) est(P) raifa(V)_ - fire burn

## Using an Object

Is an Object present so is the structure like this:

_Subject-est-Object-tia-Verb_

Example:

_fyre(S) est(P) rhyn(O) tia(P) raifa(V)_ - fire burn the earth

To indicate what is done to the Object the particle _tia_ is used.

## Plural

The particle _phen_ signals that more than one person or object is meant.

Example:

_phen(P) noicta mora_ - black wings

If a specific number of persons or objects is meant, the number is added before the particle phen.

Example:

_3 phen noicta mora_ - 3 black wings

## Using Adjectives

An Adjective stands directly before the Noun it describes. Depending on the Adjective a suffix may be added to allow a more smooth pronunciation. For example:

_noict**a** mor**a**_ - black wing

_noict_ ends on a consonant. An **a** is added to _noict_ because _mora_ ends on an **a**. So it is:

_noict**a** mor**a**_

But with another Noun it is:

_noict**e** fyr**e**_ - black flame

In case the Noun ends on a consonant it defaults to a **u** suffix:

_noict**u** rhyn_

An exception are Adjectives ending on a double consonant, which is indicated by an apostrophe: _sy'k_. In this case no suffix is used:

_sy'k fiar_ - ancient tongue
